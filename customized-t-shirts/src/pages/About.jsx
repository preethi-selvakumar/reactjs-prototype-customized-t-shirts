                        Dazzi was founded by Richard (Dick) Ward, Andrew Ward, and Ally (Ward) Delgado, and opened its doors in early 2014. After 28 years in the corporate apparel industry, Dick's vision was to launch an e-commerce business model that made the gear ordering process faster, cheaper, and more transparent for businesses.
